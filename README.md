# linear-two-class-classification
The most popular form of nonlinear regression dealt with in machine learning is called two-class classification
The first thing that distinguishes this kind of problem from the kind of regression we have seen thus far is the data itself, and more particularly its output: two-class classification datasets have output values that take on only one of two values with each value referred to as a class. Common examples of two class classification problems include face and general object detection, with classes consisting of with a face or object versus non-facial/object images, textual sentiment analysis where classes consist of written product reviews ascribing a positive or negative opinion, and automatic diagnosis of medical conditions where classes consist of medical data corresponding to patients who either do or do not have a specific malady.
